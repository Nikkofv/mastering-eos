 Mastering EOS
===============

Mastering EOS is a new initiative to produce better documentation for the Grand Valley State University School of Computer and Information Systems Exploratory Operating System Lab (GVSU CIS EOS Lab). It is intended to augment and eventually supplant the `original EOS documentation`_ located on the School of CIS website.

Mastering EOS consists of two parts:

* A poster of lesser-known useful tips and tricks that can be used by students in the EOS Lab.
* A full manual documenting both basic and advanced tasks.

Mastering EOS is written by:

* Sean Fisk, BS and MS in Computer Science from GVSU
* Ira Woodring, GVSU EOS Lab system administrator
