 TODO
======

* Symbolic link instead of copying (maybe).

* Switch to ghp-import from what we're currently doing (maybe).

* VNC

Finish Windows step-by-step guides. Decided what we want to do with Linux.

* PATH

Add information on the PATH section.

* Fix copyright section.

Too informal, and some mistakes.

* Move fabfile to top level, since we are distributing the poster now too.

* Change theme to use GVSU colors. Use black, white, the 3 blue shades from the home page, and the official blue (Pantone).
