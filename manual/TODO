 TODO
======

* Symbolic link instead of copying (maybe).

* Switch to ghp-import from what we're currently doing (maybe).

* VNC

Finish Windows step-by-step guides. Decided what we want to do with Linux.

* SSH

Add SSH SOCKS proxy trick -- Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.

* Change theme to use GVSU colors. Use black, white, the 3 blue shades from the home page, and the official blue (Pantone).

* PATH

Add information on the PATH section.

* Fix copyright section.

Too informal, and some mistakes.

* Long commands need to be wrapped. They do not get wrapped by default in the PDF and end up looking terrible. You can't even scroll to see the rest of them.

* Re-check all outputs for mistakes.

* Student contribution guide.

* Move fabfile to top level, since we are distributing the poster now too.
