* Winserv

CoRD might not be the choice for Mac OS X, since it says it's not compatible with Mavericks. Check out http://pc-addicts.com/3-remote-desktop-apps-for-os-x-mavericks/ with Winserv.

* VNC

Finish Windows step-by-step guides. Decided what we want to do with Linux.

* Shells / PATH

Expand the Shells section, consider taking out mentions of ksh and tcsh, and add path manip and prompt customization sections.

* Change theme to use GVSU colors. Use black, white, the 3 blue shades from the home page, and the official blue (Pantone).

* "Next class" Python module in prompt, e.g., ``<CIS452 in 01:42>``.

* Expand DB section; add PostgreSQL

* List of GUI libraries

* HPC? (Threading, OpenMP, MPI, C++, Python)

* Include dash rules in writing style (hair space, em vs. en vs. hyphen).

* Be clear about keycard Datacomm vs. EOS/Arch access.

* Sean asks: Do we need to mention ksh and tcsh in the shells section? Everybody I know uses Bash, and I haven't seen much interest in other shells. Even I didn't move to Zsh until I knew Bash really well.

* Sean asks: Are we going to deploy man and info pages? They are commented out right now because they haven't been updated in a while. If we aren't going to keep them updated, we should remove them from the systems.
