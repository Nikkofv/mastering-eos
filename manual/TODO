* Consistent tense/subject (we, students, users, you).

* Winserv

CoRD might not be the choice for Mac OS X, since it says it's not compatible with Mavericks. Check out http://pc-addicts.com/3-remote-desktop-apps-for-os-x-mavericks/ with Winserv.

* VNC

Finish Windows step-by-step guides. Decided what we want to do with Linux.

* Shells / PATH

Expand the Shells section, consider taking out mentions of ksh and tcsh, and add path manip and prompt customization sections.

* Change theme to use GVSU colors. Use black, white, the 3 blue shades from the home page, and the official blue (Pantone).

* Remove Sphinx M. EOS version number and module list when it doesn't make sense.
