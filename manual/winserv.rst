Accessing Winserv
=================

Part of the department infrastructure is a Windows Server installation.  Accounts for this machine are given when needed, for example when taking a course that involves teaching on the Windows platform, or working on a project that requires a Windows based setup.

Remote Desktop
==============

Winserv can be accessed via a Remote Desktop (RDP) client such as Microsoft's ``mstsc``, ``rdesktop`` from Linux/\*nix, or CoRD for Mac OSX.  Regardless of the client you choose, you will need to set the remote hostname to ``winserv.cis.gvsu.edu``.  Additionally, users must login to the CIS domain; for instance, if your username is doej you would login with cis\doej as your username.
