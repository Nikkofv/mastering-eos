Hostnames
=========

The hostnames for the EOS machines are organized as follows: :samp:`eos{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 24 and :samp:`arch{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 10. Use these names to connect to a specific EOS machine.

Logging in
==========

First, open your terminal emulator to start a shell. To connect to a specific machine, run::

    ssh smithj@eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu

You should see a prompt open to :ref:`bash`, the default shell on EOS. From here, you can run commands as you would inside a normal terminal emulator in an EOS desktop session. The commands will be run on the EOS machine to which you are logged in.
