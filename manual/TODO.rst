* Be clear about keycard Datacomm vs. EOS/Arch access.

* Sean asks: Do we need to mention ksh and tcsh in the shells section? Everybody I know uses Bash, and I haven't seen much interest in other shells. Even I didn't move to Zsh until I knew Bash really well.

* Sean asks: Are we going to deploy man and info pages? They are commented out right now because they haven't been updated in a while. If we aren't going to keep them updated, we should remove them from the systems.

* Sean asks: Is it OK to use the GVSU favicon?

* Sean asks: Is it possible to install Remmina on EOS?
