Rules and Procedures
====================

It is important that some basic rules and procedures be established to help maintain the lab and aid in its shared use.  To those ends, please be aware of the following.

Keycards
========

CIS labs are highly specialized labs paid for and maintained with department resources.  These machines are not for the general computing public.  Students therefore are required to obtain a keycard before they can gain access to the labs.  To get a keycard students must

     - currently have a class in the lab they want access to
     - visit the computing office in Mak C-2-100
     - pay a $25 deposit that is refunded to the student when the card is returned

We charge a deposit on the cards because they are costly for us to purchase and we need to ensure they will be returned and properly taken care of.  The $25 deposit is charged to the student's account so no money actually changes hands.  A refund of $25 will be placed on the student's account when the card is returned.

It is important that students 

     - do not allow anyone else to use your card
     - do not keep the card in your wallet, as the cards contain tiny hair-like wires that break easily

The keycards also gain the holder access to Mackinac Hall during after hours as well.
