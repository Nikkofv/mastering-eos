==============================
 Accessing EOS Remotely (SSH)
==============================

If you are not sitting in the EOS or Arch lab, EOS can be accessed from home using a protocol called Secure Shell (SSH). SSH allows you to remotely run commands on any EOS machine.

The hostnames for the EOS machines are organized as follows: :samp:`eos{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 24 and :samp:`arch{XX}.cis.gvsu.edu` where :samp:`{XX}` is 01 through 10. Use these names to connect to a specific EOS machine.

Your SSH client of choice depends on your machine's operating system.
