This is your SSH client requesting you to validate the identity of the machine to which you are connecting.

Each EOS machine has a so-called fingerprint, a series of characters which is used to verify its identity. To ensure that an attacker between your client and the actual EOS machine is not pretending to be an EOS machine, you must check that the machine's fingerprint matches the table below. Please report any mismatches to the system administrator immediately.
