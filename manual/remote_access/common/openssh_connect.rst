Logging in
==========

First, open your terminal emulator to start a shell. To connect to a specific machine, run::

    ssh smithj@eosXX.cis.gvsu.edu

You should see a prompt open to :ref:`bash`, the default shell on EOS. From here, you can run commands as you would inside a normal terminal emulator in an EOS desktop session. The commands will be run on the EOS machine to which you are logged in.
