Introduction to the EOS Labs (Plural)
===========================================

When referring to the Grand Valley State University School of Computing and Information Systems custom computing setup, we often merely use the term EOS.  Though EOS is only one of our specialized computing labs, it is the one most often used by the greatest variety of students.  As it was the original custom lab to be developed, and the other labs are (largely) based on it, it sometimes makes sense to refer to the infrastructure as the EOS labs.  Therefore, when reading this document, the following terms may be helpful.

     - **EOS Labs** refers to the custom computing infrastructure provided for School of Computing and Information Systems students.
     - **EOS Lab** refers to the (E)xploring (O)perating (S)ystems lab located in Mak A-1-171.
     - **Arch Lab** refers to the (Arch)itecture lab located in Mak A-1-101.
     - **Datacomm Lab** refers to the networking and (Datacomm)unication lab located in Mak A-1-167.
     - **Hardware Lab** refers to the multi-purpose lab in Mak A-1-105.

Each of these labs was created for a specific purpose.  EOS was (as the name implies) created to facilitate operating system discovery and research, while the Arch lab was created to study the effects of various hardware architectures on programming tasks.
