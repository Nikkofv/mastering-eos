Integrated Development Environments
===================================

Prgramming is often aided by the use of an integrated development environment (IDE).  On the EOS system we provide several IDEs to assist in programming tasks.

BlueJ
=====

BlueJ is an IDE designed with learning in mind.  While it may not be the best for large scale projects, it is certainly one of the best IDEs for learning to program Java.  Its object inspector makes it quite easy for new programmers to examine objects as they progress through a software instance's life cycle.  BlueJ may be accessed by typing :program:`bluej` from the command line.

Eclipse
=======

Eclipse is a powerful, extensible, free, open-source IDE that can be used with a large number of languages.  Java, PHP, Python, C, C++, and Android support is installed by default on the EOS system, and others can be quickly and easily added if needed.  Eclipse may be accessed by typing :program:`eclipse` from the command line.

IntelliJ
========

For those that don't like Eclipse we also provide the IntelliJ IDE.  IntelliJ is a professional quality IDE and rather expensive to buy.  IntelliJ is setup for Java programming.  IntelliJ may be accessed by typing :program:`idea.sh` from the command line.
