Integrated Development Environments
===================================

Prgramming is often aided by the use of an integrated development environment (IDE).  On the EOS system, we provide several IDEs to assist in programming tasks.

BlueJ
=====

BlueJ is an IDE designed with learning in mind.  While it is not the best choice advanced users or large-scale projects, it is one of the best IDEs for learning to program in Java.  BlueJ's object inspector makes it quite easy for new programmers to examine objects as they progress through a software instance's life cycle.  BlueJ may be accessed by typing :program:`bluej` from the command line.

Eclipse
=======

Eclipse is a powerful, extensible, free and open-source IDE that can be used with a large number of languages.  Java, PHP, Python, C, C++, and Android support is installed by default on the EOS system, and others can be quickly and easily added if needed.  Eclipse may be accessed by typing :program:`eclipse` from the command line.

IntelliJ
========

For those that don't like Eclipse, we also provide the IntelliJ Java IDE.  IntelliJ is a professional quality IDE and rather expensive to purchase.  IntelliJ may be accessed by typing :program:`idea.sh` from the command line.
