\begin{block}{Downloading files}
  Both commands listed download a copy of the IRS W4 form. \texttt{wget} is a general-purpose file downloader while \texttt{curl} is great at crafting custom requests. As mentioned elsewhere on the poster, \texttt{aria2} is another option but is not typically included with a base system (you must install it yourself).

      curl 'http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf' > fw4.pdf
