\begin{block}{Multiple terminals}
  As an alternative to opening multiple terminals running \texttt{ssh} or multiple PuTTY windows, terminal multiplexers such as \texttt{screen} and \texttt{tmux} may be used. \texttt{tmux} is recommended. Type \command{tmux} once SSH'd to start it. \\[0.7em]
  \textbf{Default \texttt{tmux} bindings:} \\
  {\newcommand{\key}[1]{\texttt{C-b #1}}
    \textbf{\key{c}} means \command{Control + b}, then \command{c}.
